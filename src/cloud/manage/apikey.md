# API Keys

On VectorChord Cloud, every project comes with a set of API keys. These keys are essential authentication tokens required for initiating terraform operations.

## Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is a crucial security mechanism in VectorChord Cloud, applicable to managing API calls. This system allows for fine-grained control over access to resources by assigning roles with specific permissions to users within the projects.

For more information on access levels of each role, see [Authorization](./authorization.md).

# Workflow

## Overview

Workflow is a feature that allow you can use some pre-defined functions to complete some tasks. For example, you can use `ExternalBuildIndex` workflow to build index externally for your Postgres cluster. There are some advantages of using workflow:
- **Out Of Box**: You can use the pre-defined functions to complete some tasks without writing any code.
- **Accelerate Tasks**: You can use a server with a higher resource configuration than the PostgreSQL cluster to accelerate the task.
- **Cluster Stability**: The workflow is executed in a separate server, which will not affect the stability of the PostgreSQL cluster. 
- **Low Cost**: You do not need to pay continuously like a database for high configuration resources for short-term tasks.

## Supported Workflows

Supported workflows are as follows:
- [ExternalBuildIndex](#ExternalBuildIndex)

### ExternalBuildIndex

The `ExternalBuildIndex` workflow is used to build vchord index externally for your Postgres cluster, details can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord?tab=readme-ov-file#external-index-precomputation).

In dashboard, you can click the `Create Workflow` button to create a new workflow.

You need to specify the following information:
- **Workflow Name**: A unique name for your workflow.
- **Option**: The option for `ExternalBuildIndex` workflow 
    - **Table**: The table where the vector is located
    - **Column**: Vector column name
    - **Dimension**: The dimension of the vector
    - **Lists**: KMeans n list
    - **DistanceMetric**: The distance metric for the vector
        - **DistanceMetricCosine**: Cosine distance
        - **DistanceMetricL2**: Euclidean distance
        - **DistanceMetricDot**: Dot product distance

After submitting the workflow, the workflow will be in the `Running` status. The workflow will be unavailable during the running process. The running process may take a few minutes to complete. After the running process is completed, the workflow will be in the `Succeeded` status. You can list all the workflows in the dashboard.

You can check the detail of every step in the workflow detail page.

When the workflow is in the `Succeeded` status, you can validate the index is ready to use.

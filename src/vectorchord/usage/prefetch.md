# Prefetch <badge type="tip" text="since v0.4.0" />

Prefetch dramatically accelerates queries that involve I/O operations. It works by proactively reading buffers into operating system page cache or PostgreSQL's buffer pool based on the actual needs of the index.

Prefetch helps overlap I/O with computation, as well as I/O with other I/O operations, significantly reducing the time spent waiting for buffers during query execution, thereby improving overall query performance.

:::tip
This feature is enabled by default. Any query can benefit from prefetching with VectorChord `0.4.0` and later versions.
:::

Prior to version `0.4.0`, VectorChord used PostgreSQL's synchronous I/O interface. Since then, VectorChord utilizes asynchronous I/O interface on newer versions of PostgreSQL. The I/O interface used by VectorChord can be controlled via GUC parameters.

In the GUC parameters, the synchronous I/O interface is referred to as `read_buffer`, the asynchronous I/O interface as `read_stream`, and VectorChord's simulated asynchronous interface as `prefetch_buffer`.

For indexes much smaller than the memory, there is almost no difference among the three prefetch modes. `read_stream` accelerates all disk-based indexes; however, it is only available on PostgreSQL 17. To address this, VectorChord provides a simulated asynchronous I/O interface called `prefetch_buffer`, which is available on all PostgreSQL versions as a fallback for older versions. `prefetch_buffer` is less effective than `read_stream`.

| Prefetch Mode     | Description                                                                                      | Supported PostgreSQL Versions |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `read_stream`     | Asynchronous I/O interface in PostgreSQL                                                         | PostgreSQL 17                 |
| `prefetch_buffer` | VectorChord's simulated asynchronous I/O interface used as fallback on older PostgreSQL versions | PostgreSQL 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 |
| `read_buffer`     | Synchronous I/O interface in PostgreSQL                                                          | PostgreSQL 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 |

Furthermore, the [Asynchronous I/O](https://pganalyze.com/blog/postgres-18-async-io) that will be introduced in PostgreSQL 18 will make `read_stream` more advantageous.

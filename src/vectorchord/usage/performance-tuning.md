# Performance Tuning

## Index Build Time

Index building can be parallelized, and with external centroid precomputation. Optimize parallelism using the following settings:

```SQL
-- Set this to the number of CPU cores available for parallel operations.
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8;
SET max_parallel_workers = 8;

-- Adjust the total number of worker processes. 
-- Note: A restart is required for this setting to take effect.
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_worker_processes = 16;
```

When building an index on a table with more than 10 million vectors, you can choose to consume more memory to accelerate the process by setting `build.pin` to `true`:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING vchordrq (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (options = $$
residual_quantization = false
build.pin = true
$$);
```

## Query Performance
You can fine-tune the search performance by adjusting the `probes` and `epsilon` parameters:

```sql
-- Set probes to control the number of lists scanned. 
-- Recommended range: 3%–10% of the total `lists` value.
SET vchordrq.probes = 100;

-- Set epsilon to control the reranking precision.
-- Larger value means more rerank for higher recall rate and latency.
-- If you need a less precise query, setting it to 1.0 may be appropriate.
-- Recommended range: 1.0–1.9. Default value is 1.9.
SET vchordrq.epsilon = 1.9;

-- vchordrq relies on a projection matrix to optimize performance.
-- Add your vector dimensions to the `prewarm_dim` list to reduce latency.
-- If this is not configured, the first query will have higher latency as the matrix is generated on demand.
-- Default value: '64,128,256,384,512,768,1024,1536'
-- Note: This setting requires a database restart to take effect.
ALTER SYSTEM SET vchordrq.prewarm_dim = '64,128,256,384,512,768,1024,1536';
```

And for postgres's setting
```SQL
-- If using SSDs, set `effective_io_concurrency` to 200 for faster disk I/O.
SET effective_io_concurrency = 200;

-- Disable JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation) as it offers minimal benefit (1–2%) 
-- and adds overhead for single-query workloads.
SET jit = off;

-- Allocate at least 25% of total memory to `shared_buffers`. 
-- For disk-heavy workloads, you can increase this to up to 90% of total memory. You may also want to disable swap with network storage to avoid io hang.
-- Note: A restart is required for this setting to take effect.
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '8GB';
```

## Index Internal Build

There are 4 options for index internal build, except `lists`.

* `spherical_centroids`: Specifies whether to use spherical K-means algorithm. If the model generates cosine similarity embeddings, set this to `true`; otherwise, set to `false`. Possible values: `true`, `false`. Default: `false`.

* `sampling_factor`: Specifies the number of vectors sampled by K-means algorithm. The higher this value, the slower the build, the greater the memory consumption, and the better search performance. Possible values: any integer between `1` and `1024`. Default: `256`.

* `kmeans_iterations`: Specifies the number of iterations for K-means algorithm. The higher this value, the slower the build. Possible values: any integer between `0` and `1024`. Default: `10`.

* `build_threads`: Specifies the number of threads used by K-means algorithm. The higher this value, the faster the build. Possible values: any integer between `1` and `255`. Default: `1`.

An example of these options:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON t USING vchordrq (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (options = $$
residual_quantization = false
[build.internal]
lists = [1000]
spherical_centroids = true
sampling_factor = 512
kmeans_iterations = 25
build_threads = 16
$$);
```

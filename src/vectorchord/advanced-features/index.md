| Index Prewarm                  | Optimize your first query performance for VectorChord index. Discover VectorChord's Index Prewarm technique to significantly reduce latency by loading indices into memory. | [Index Prewarm](/vectorchord/advanced-features/index-prewarm) |
| Prefetch                       | Unlock lightning-fast data access with VectorChord's prefetch feature. Minimizes disk latency and utilizes new PostgreSQL streaming I/O for significant performance gains. | [Prefetch](/vectorchord/advanced-features/prefetch)          |
| Prefiltering | Optimize vector search performance in VectorChord by understanding prefiltering. Discover how applying additional filter can improve speed based on selectivity.                        | [Prefiltering](/vectorchord/advanced-features/prefiltering) |
| Rerank In Table                | VectorChord offers configurations to prioritize either speed or disk space. Learn how different data storage options balance index size and query performance based on your needs. | [Rerank In Table](/vectorchord/advanced-features/rerank-in-table) |
| External Index Precomputation  | Achieve significantly faster vector indexing for large datasets using external precomputation. This method clusters data externally before insertion, accelerating build speeds by up to 16 times. | [External Index Precomputation](/vectorchord/advanced-features/external-index-precomputation) |

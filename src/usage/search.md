# Search

The SQL for searching is very simple. Here is an example of searching the $5$ nearest embedding in table `items`:

```sql
SET vectors.hnsw_ef_search = 64;
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,2,1]' LIMIT 5;
```

The vector index will search for `64` nearest rows, and `5` nearest rows is gotten since there is a `LIMIT` clause.

## Search modes

There are two search modes: `basic` and `vbase`.

### `basic`

`basic` is the default search mode. In this mode, vector indexes behave like a vector search library. It works well if all of your queries is like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,2,1]' LIMIT 5;
```

It's recommended if your do **not** take advantages of

* database transaction
* deletions without `VACUUM`
* WHERE clauses and very complex SQL statements

### `vbase`

`vbase` is another search mode. In this mode, vector indexes behave like a database index. In `vbase` mode, searching results become a stream and every time the database pulls a row, the vector index computes a row to return. It's quite different from an ordinary vector search if you are using a vector search library, such as *faiss*. The latter always wants to know how many results are needed before searching. The original idea comes from [VBASE: Unifying Online Vector Similarity Search and Relational Queries via Relaxed Monotonicity](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi23/presentation/zhang-qianxi).

Assuming you are using HNSW algorithm, you may want the following SQL to work:

```sql
SET vectors.hnsw_ef_search = 64;
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,2,1]' WHERE id % 2 = 0 LIMIT 64;
```

In `basic` mode, you may only get `32` rows because the HNSW algorithm does search simply so the filter condition is ignored.

In `vbase` mode, the HNSW algorithm is guaranteed to return rows as many as you need, so you can always get correct behavior if your do take advantages of:

* database transaction
* deletions without `VACUUM`
* `WHERE` clauses and very complex SQL statements

You can enable `vbase` by a SQL statement `SET vectors.search_mode = vbase;`.

## Prefilter

If your queries include a `WHERE` clause, you can set set search mode to `vbase`. It's good and it even works on all conditions. `vbase` is a **postfilter** method: it pulls rows as many as you need, but it scans rows that you may not need. Since some rows will definitely be removed by the `WHERE` clause, we can skip scanning them, which will make the search faster. We call it **prefilter**.

Prefilter speeds your query in the following condition:

* You create a multicolumn vector index containing a vector column and many payload columns.
* The `WHERE` clause in a query is just simple like `(id % 2 = 0) AND (age >  50)`.

Prefilter is also used in internal implementation for handling deleted rows in `pgvecto.rs`.

Prefilter may have a negative impact on precision. Test the precision before using it.

Prefilter is enabled by default because it almost only works if you create a multicolumn vector index.

## Options

Search options are specified by PostgreSQL GUC. You can use `SET` command to apply these options in session or `SET LOCAL` command to apply these options in transaction.

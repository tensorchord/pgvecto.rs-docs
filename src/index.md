features:
  - title: Fast
    details: 20x faster than pgvector at 90% recall.
  - title: 100% Rust
    details: pgvecto.rs is implemented in Rust rather than C like many existing Postgres extensions. Rust provides many advantages for an extension like pgvecto.rs.
  - title: Relational + Semantic Search
    details: pgvecto.rs allows you to use the same SQL interface for both relational and semantic search (and even combine them).
